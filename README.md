# Fake_News_Detector

What is Fake News. Fake news refers to information content that is false, misleading or whose source cannot be verified. This content may be generated to intentionally damage reputations, deceive, or to gain attention.

# Introduction

I have made a Fake News Classification project using Machine Learning. I have created a flask web app, which will take the news as input and give the result about news is fake or real.

What things were used in this project:

PassiveAggresive algorithm for classification.

TFIDFVectorizer for handling the news data

Flask for handling the backend of the web app

Simple HTML+CSS for the frontend of the site.

# Conclusion
•	An algorithm that is being used to detect false news is politically unbiased, as fake news exists on both ends of the tunnel and it gives equal balance to legitimate news sources on both ends of the tunnel.

•	Currently available systems are slow learners and don't focus on active learning. Moreover, they are trained to classify news in binary. They don't have a matrix to compare the chance of two news relative to each other to be true.
